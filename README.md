# Extra Configuration
The following configuration are not required, but could be useful some day.

### Dnsmasq (Linux/macOS)
[Dnsmasq](http://www.thekelleys.org.uk/dnsmasq/doc.html) is a very well-known package in *nix world (Mac OS X is Unix, Ubuntu is Linux).
It provides network infrastructure for small networks such as DNS, DHCP, router advertisement and network boot.
If you need to point a domain to a specified IP address like *.test*, *.dev*, *.xxx* to *127.0.0.1* or your `<private-ip>`, you will need Dnsmasq!
